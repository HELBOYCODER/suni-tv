A native Android port of the global live-streaming service [famelack.com](https://famelack.com),

## Build locally

You need **JDK 17** and the **Android SDK 34**. Then:

```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug         # debug APK
./gradlew assembleRelease       # release APK (signed with debug key for CI)
```

The release APK is **auto-built by GitHub Actions** on every push to `main` and
published to the [Releases](https://github.com/HELBOYCODER/suni-tv/releases)
page as a downloadable asset on `v*` tags.

## Download

Grab the latest `app-release.apk` from the [Releases page](https://github.com/HELBOYCODER/suni-tv/releases).
The APK is signed with the standard Android debug key (so you can install it
alongside future Famelack builds without uninstalling). Enable *Install unknown
apps* in your system settings to install from the APK.

## Data source

The bundled 4.91 MB `famelack_data.json.gz` is built from
[famelack/famelack-data](https://github.com/famelack/famelack-data) (CC-BY-SA 4.0),
which itself is curated from publicly-accessible live TV, radio, and webcam
streams and validated by the Famelack ingestion pipeline (uptime checks, geo-block
detection, format verification).

## How it works

- **First launch** the app unzips `famelack_data.json.gz` (≈5 MB) into a single
  `JSONObject` in memory — fast enough that subsequent queries are pure hash lookups.
- **HLS streams** are handed to ExoPlayer via a `MediaController` bound to a
  foreground `MediaSessionService`, so audio continues when the app is backgrounded
  and shows up in the system media notification.
- **YouTube Live** sources are loaded into a `WebView` with the
  `youtube-nocookie.com/embed/...` URL, which avoids tracking cookies and works
  in-app without leaving Famelack.
- **Favorites** are stored in `DataStore<Preferences>` as a comma-separated id set.
  Because we re-scan the in-memory `JSONObject` to resolve each id to a `Channel`,
  there is no separate favorites database to keep in sync with upstream data.
